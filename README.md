# GitHub Dependency Extractor

A Gradle plugin for extracting dependencies from a Gradle build to feed the GitHub Dependency API.

This project is currently just a proof of concept, but ideally, this plugin would be automatically
applied to any Gradle project using the GitHub Action [gradle-build-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gradle-build-action).
